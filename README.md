# 🕊️ Atlas Canvas — Professional Visual Intelligence Workspace

> **Advanced VISINT Infrastructure. Infinite Canvas. Neural-Link AI Synthesis.**

Atlas Canvas is a professional-grade **Visual Intelligence (VISINT)** and **Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)** workspace. It provides a high-fidelity, infinite canvas environment where digital investigators can map infrastructure, correlate identity footprints, and synthesize intelligence using state-of-the-art AI.

Designed for low-light tactical environments, Atlas combines premium aesthetics with automated research pipelines to transform raw data into actionable intelligence.

## 🛰️ Core Intelligence Capabilities

### 🧠 AI-Powered Analyst Engine
Perform deep-spectrum research on **Emails, IPs, Domains, Usernames, and Crypto Wallets**. The backend engine autonomously queries surface and dark web indices, providing professional-grade bio-synthesis and threat classification.

### 🔍 Omni-Search Spotlight (`Cmd + K`)
The centralized command center for your investigation. Omni-search crawls your active canvas, local system directories, and global intelligence databases across multiple spectrums (Text, Files, Visual Data) to surface hidden correlations.

### 🔗 Automated Neural Mapping
Leverage automated relationship detection. Atlas identifies shared indicators (pivots) between target nodes and dynamically constructs a relationship graph, visualizing complex infrastructure overlaps in real-time.

### 🎭 Tactical HUD & Visuals
*   **Atmospheric Neural Pulse**: A breathing UI that responds to active research cycles.
*   **High-Frequency Glitch Rendering**: Visual indicators for malicious footprints and signal interference.
*   **Curated Dark Mode**: High-contrast, glassmorphic interface designed for 24/7 operational focus.

## 🚀 Deployment & Access Guide

### 1. Prerequisite Infrastructure
Ensure your environment meets the following specifications:
*   **Node.js**: Version 18.0 or higher
*   **Python**: Version 3.9 or higher

### 2. Implementation

#### **A. Frontend HUD**
```bash
# Clone the intelligence repository
git clone https://github.com/Aaryankansari/atlas-canvas.git
cd atlas-canvas

# Initialize dependencies
npm install

# Launch the Tactical Workspace
npm run dev
```

#### **B. OSINT Researcher Backend**
```bash
# Navigate to the engine core
cd backend

# Establish virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Install researcher requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the Intelligence Engine
python main.py
```

### 🧠 Level-3 AI Configuration (Gemini)
To enable real-time, LLM-driven intelligence synthesis:
1. Create a `.env` file in the `/backend` directory.
2. Define your Google Gemini API Key: `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_secured_key`.
3. Restart the engine. Atlas will automatically pivot from mock-bio generation to Gemini-powered deep research.

## 🛠️ Operational Workflow

1.  **Initialize Target**: Open the **AI Analyst** (Brain Icon) or use **Omni Search** (`Cmd+K`) to input your primary indicator.
2.  **Conduct Deep Search**: Select **Deep Researcher** mode for a multi-stage investigation (Neural Link, Surface Recon, Darknet Correlation).
3.  **Forge Intelligence**: Toggle **Auto-Map Intelligence** to automatically materialize discovered nodes on the canvas.
4.  **Monitor Footprints**: Right-click any node to **Watch entity**. The Live Radar will broadcast real-time telemetry updates.
5.  **Pivot & Expand**: Inspect result categories to identify secondary indicators and expand the research graph.

## 🛡️ OPSEC & Security Protocols
Atlas Canvas is designed for professional use. Users are strictly advised to maintain high Operational Security:
*   **Routing**: Always utilize a VPN or Proxy chain when conducting live research.
*   **Privacy**: All investigation state is managed locally. Atlas does not log or transmit your queries to external third-party servers except for specified SDK integrations.
